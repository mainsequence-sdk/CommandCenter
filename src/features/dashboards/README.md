# Workspaces Feature

This folder owns the `Workspaces` app experience shipped by the core extension.

It currently covers three user flows:

- the workspace index table
- the workspace canvas editor
- the workspace settings page

These flows are all part of one app surface, with instance state selected through query params.

## Entry Points

- `WorkspacesPage.tsx`: landing page for the `Workspaces` app. Lists all locally stored workspaces and routes into a selected workspace instance.
- `CustomDashboardStudioPage.tsx`: full-bleed workspace canvas editor with widget drag, resize, controls, and save flow.
- `CustomWorkspaceSettingsPage.tsx`: model editor for workspace metadata such as title, description, and labels.
- `useCustomWorkspaceStudio.ts`: route-aware hook that resolves the requested workspace instance and exposes shared actions.
- `custom-workspace-studio-store.ts`: shared draft/saved workspace state used across the list, canvas, and settings views.
- `custom-dashboard-storage.ts`: local-storage persistence, workspace creation helpers, grid migration logic, and widget mutation helpers.
- `workspace-favorites.ts`: helper functions for workspace-instance favorites and canonical workspace paths.

## Current Model

- The app is registered in `src/extensions/core/index.ts` as a single full-bleed page surface: `workspaces`.
- The workspace list lives at `/app/workspace-studio/workspaces`.
- Opening a workspace instance adds `?workspace=<id>`.
- Opening workspace settings adds `?workspace=<id>&view=settings`.
- Persistence is browser-local and user-scoped through `localStorage`.
- Favorites can target both app surfaces and individual workspace instances.
- Workspace labels are edited in settings as enter-to-add pills instead of a comma-separated text field.
- Workspace settings also expose versioned JSON export/import for full workspace snapshots.
- Widget runtime state can persist in the workspace model when a widget reports it through the shared widget contract.

## Important Dependencies

- `@/dashboards/*`: dashboard layout types, grid resolution, and shared dashboard controls.
- `@/widgets/types` and the app registry: widget catalog lookup and widget rendering.
- `@/stores/shell-store`: cross-shell UI state such as favorites and workspace menu visibility.
- `react-router-dom`: query-param based workspace instance routing.

## Maintenance Notes

- Keep this README in sync when the workspace route model, persistence contract, favorites model, or settings/canvas split changes.
- Update this README when the JSON snapshot schema or widget runtime-state contract changes.
- Update `docs/workspaces.md` whenever the user-facing Workspaces behavior changes in a meaningful way.
- If this folder splits into smaller feature directories later, add nested `README.md` files near the new ownership boundaries.
